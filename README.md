## Data
Our code relies on multiple CSV files for experiments. 
You can find them in the current directory  `C101_30.csv', 'depot1_1.csv` .

- `C101_30.csv`: This file contains the customer information used for experiments.
- `depot1_1.csv`: This file contains the depot information used for experiments.

Additional dataset used in the experiment can be emailed to 211420077@st.usst.edu.cn

##  how to run the code
```bash
python main.py --input C101_30.csv, depot1_1.csv --output results.csv
```
